## About

This is a Pokemon Emerald decompilation project which uses
the PokeEmerald Expansion project as a base. I am currently
using this project as a way to learn the Emerald codebase. 
I will be building an expanded version of the base game, 
rather than an entirely new game and world. However, there
are several features which I would like to implement within
the development of this project. 

The eventual goal for this project is to create a sandbox for
players to enjoy the incredible post-game content in Emerald, 
such as the Battle Frontier and other facilities which have
been completely lacking since Generation 7 using new Pokemon
and simple methods for obtaining properly trained, competitive
Pokemon easily without the need for modifying save files.
