## About

This is a Pokemon Emerald decompilation project which uses
the PokeEmerald Expansion project as a base. I am currently
using this project as a way to learn the Emerald codebase. 
I will be building an expanded version of the base game, 
rather than an entirely new game and world. However, there
are several features which I would like to implement within
the development of this project.

## Planned Features

Please note, this is not an exhaustive list and may 
be expanded or reduced at any time.

### General

* Updated spawn tables for new Pokemon (gen 4+)

### Battle Frontier

* Pokemon EV/IV Customiser (NPC/item/etc.)
* New Pokemon in Battle Frontier 
* Mega Evolutions in Battle Frontier
* New tiers in Battle Frontier (i.e. ubers, restricted, etc.)
* Custom trainers in Battle Frontier
