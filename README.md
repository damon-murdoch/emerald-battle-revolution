# Emerald Battle Revolution
## Pokemon Emerald Decompilation Project, based on the PokeEmerald Expansion Project
### Created by Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://twitter.com/SirScrubbington))

## About

Emerald Battle Revolution is a Pokemon Emerald decompilation project 
which uses the PokeEmerald Expansion project as a base. The goal for 
this project is to create a sandbox for players to enjoy the incredible 
post-game content in Emerald such as the Battle Frontier and other 
facilities using new Pokemon and simple methods for obtaining properly 
trained, competitive Pokemon easily without the need for modifying save files.

## Key Features

All of the features provided by the pokeemerald-expanded upcoming branch
are included, of which there are too many to feature here. Many of these
features are still in development, so you are likely to encounter bugs or other mechanical issues while playing. If you experience an issue and would like to report it, please [open an issue](https://github.com/damon-murdoch/emerald-battle-revolution/issues). 

For more information about the pokeemerald-expanded project, please 
check out their [github repository](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion).

### Sandbox Mode

When starting the game, you may choose to be transferred to the battle
frontier with the story completed up to becoming the champion.

You will be given $300,000 to start the game, as well as a Swampert and
Talonflame for using important HMs such as Fly, Surf, Waterfall, etc.

All TMs / HMs / Key Items can be purchased in the Battle Frontier
Underground.

## Branches

### Main (Release)

This is the main release branch for the software, where the latest stable version
of the code will be deployed. This will be kept up to date with the latest stable 
`dev` release.

### Dev (Development)

This is the main development branch for the software, which is where code which is actively
being worked on is stored. This branch has the debug menu enabled, as well as other debugging
features. This branch is generally not advised to be used for a genuine playthrough, and may 
not always be in a compiling state when committed.

## Frontier-Dev (Development)

This branch is used to merge updates from my ([battle frontier generator branch](https://github.com/damon-murdoch/pokeemerald-expansion/tree/frontier-set-generator-upcoming)), which is used for developing the Battle Frontier
Modernised Set-Generation feature. This is developed on a seperate project, to allow for other romhackers to 
implement this feature on their own projects.

## Changelog

Please see below for the Dragapult Emerald project changelog. For changes related to
the PokeEmerald Expanded project, please see the [PokeEmerald Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

### Ver. 1.1.0

Merged upstream changes which have implemented a more efficient species selection system, including ensuring that two restricted (i.e. legendary) Pokemon are picked on all teams in the 'Open' rules battle mode when playing doubles (with four Pokemon), and one is selected playing in formats where three Pokemon are selected.

Mythicals are now legal to be used in all level 50 and open rules formats, and have been added to the normal selection pool for both (Excluding Arceus and Deoxys, which are considered restricted).

Special cases have now been added for selecting moves such as Icy Wind, Trick Room, Tailwind and some others which will make them more likely to be chosen appropriately (even when 'attacks only' mode is chosen).

Other issues with fusion formes (e.g. Kyurem, Calyrex) not appearing has been resolved, and incomplete 
species such as Pecharunt and Terapagos have been removed from the available species list.

Extensive testing has been performed on each Battle Frontier facility, to ensure that features are working
as expected. Issues with level scaling have now been resolved in all facilities, and new set generation
has been confirmed as working in most facilities. For a full list of all features which are currently
supported in each Battle Facility, including Battle Tents please see the [Battle Frontier Feature Table](#feature-table).

### Ver. 1.0.1

Updated config to revert changes which prevented Battle Frontier set randomisation from working as expected

### Ver. 1.0.0

Major update: Battle Frontier Modernised Set-Generator has been implemented, with over a 
months worth of development on a seperate repository ([battle frontier generator branch](https://github.com/damon-murdoch/pokeemerald-expansion/tree/frontier-set-generator-upcoming)) so it may be used by other projects. An NPC has been
added to the Battle Frontier Underground which allows for the customisation of Battle Frontier
Facilities, with the following options:

* Change between legacy (original) Battle Frontier Sets, or modern (randomised) Battle Frontier Sets with new Pokemon, moves, etc.
* Change between different team generation modes (modern sets only), with the following options:
  * Default: Default level-up learnsets at level 50
  * Random: Completely randomised movesets
  * Filtered: Randomised movesets, with moves filtered out based on stats / hard-coded moves to select/ignore.
  * Filtered (Attacks Only): Randomised movesets, with moves filtered out based on stats / hard-coded moves to select/ignore. Aside from status moves marked as 'required', or Pokemon who do not have four valid attacks, only attacking moves will be used.
  * Ranked: Randomised movesets, with moves filtered out based on stats / hard-coded moves to select/ignore. Attacking moves are 'ranked' based on a viability table, so in general stronger moves are picked over weaker moves (accounting for STAB, abilities, etc.)
  * Ranked (Attacks Only): Randomised movesets, with moves filtered out based on stats / hard-coded moves to select/ignore. Attacking moves are 'ranked' based on a viability table, so in general stronger moves are picked over weaker moves (accounting for STAB, abilities, etc). Aside from status moves marked as 'required', or Pokemon who do not have four valid attacks, only attacking moves will be used.
* Change the background music during Battle Frontier matches

For the 'Default' and 'Random' settings, EVs are invested in bulk (HP required, then Def/Spdef randomly) and a neutral nature is
used. Otherwise, evs/ivs/nature are selected based upon the base-stats of the Pokemon, where nature and evs will be invested in
whichever stats are highest first. Signature Z-Moves and Mega Evolutions may be used in the later matches (~41+), 

There is still a significant amount of work expected to be done on this part of the project, however it is currently in a completely
playable state. Please note, this has only been tested in Battle Tower Singles and Doubles so far, however further testing and 
development will be conducted to ensure all features work in the other facilities as well. Team generation takes about ~1 second 
to complete (can be quicker with default/random methods, as they are simpler). In future, this will be worked on to reduce wait 
time and attempt to reduce performance impacts. Please keep in mind, however that while these features are still in active 
development you may encounter crashes or other issues whilst using these features. If you do, please feel free to open an
issue with the project describing the crash so it can be investigated.

### Ver. 0.9.8

have been added, for purposes such as ev/iv training, battle items, tm/hms and more.

### Ver. 0.5.4

Legendary seller has been implemented up to generation six, and an additional feature
has been added to multichoice2 which allows for the 'left' and 'right' bumpers to be

level scaling now works without issues for both open level (level 100) and level 50 rules. 

### Ver. 0.4.4

Implemented level scaling system for Battle Frontier facilities, which allows for Pokemon above level 50 to participate
in level 50 battles and optionally, pokemon below level 50 can be raised to level 50 or level 100 in Open Battles. As a
result, the minimum level for Open Battles has been raised to 100 to ensure Pokemon all have the same level.

### Ver. 0.4.3

Implemented `voloved`'s [PC Access in PokeNav](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Add-PC-Access-in-PokeNav) tutorial, as well as [allow Move Relearner to Teach Moves that Pre Evolutions Know](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Allow-Move-Relearner-to-Teach-Moves-that-Pre-Evolutions-Know). Implemented `Diego Marten`'s [Move Relearner as an option in the Pok√©mon Party Screen](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10470602) tutorial. Implemented `Lunos`'s [Party swap with select](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/compare/master...LOuroboros:partyScrQuickSwap) tutorial, as well as [Nicknaming as an option in the Pok√©mon Party Screen](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Nickname-your-Pok%C3%A9mon-from-the-party-menu)

### Ver. 0.4.2

Implemented `Lunos`'s [2-in-1-bike](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10217718&postcount=172) 
tutorial, and modified the bike shop scripts to adjust it for the new behavior. Swapped the order of battle
mechanic items to be the following:
* 2nd Gym: Z Power Ring
* 4th Gym: Mega Ring
* 6th Gym: Tera Orb
* 8th Gym: Dynamax Band
Shops have also been modified to unlock relevant items for each mechanic as they are unlocked.

### Ver. 0.4.1

Battle mechanic items (e.g. Mega Power Ring) will now be recieved during the story, after
defeating the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th gyms respectively. The order is as follows:
* 2nd Gym: Mega Ring
* 4th Gym: Z Power Ring
* 6th Gym: Dynamax Band
* 8th Gym: Tera Orb
After defeating these gyms, the related items will become available in the Pokemart. Flags
for enabling and disabling most optional mechanics have also been implemented, for both
debug and in-game purposes.

### Ver. 0.4.0

Special sellers in each Pokemart have been completely reworked, and the item table for each
has been overhauled to provide a variety of unique items for the player to use while progressing
through the game. Mega Stones, Z-Crystals, Dynamax Candies and Tera Shards will be made available
in each special shop where other items of the same type are also available (e.g. Sootopolis will 
have Dragonium Z and Tera Dragon Shards). Trainer Hill, Lilycove Department Store, Evergrande 
City and the Battle Frontier all have unique secondary special shops which do not follow the
general pattern of the other special shops.

### Ver. 0.3.1

Removed unnecessary files, modified item prices, fixed issues with mochi seller, 
added special shop vendors with static, randomised contents to each Pokemart. 
Implemented and tested multichoice2, which allows for an easy method for 
implementing multiple choice menus. 

### Ver. 0.3.0

Completed rough spawn tables up to route 120, with recurring patterns for water/fishing
encounter tables and mostly new spawn tables for wild encounters (Original wild encounters
remain available, but with lower spawn rate).

### Ver. 0.2.2

Merged upcoming branch of PokeEmerald-Expanded into the project, which adds support for
several new features including all of the Generation 9 Pokemon (so far), Dynamax, most of
the new items, and more. Resolved several merge conflicts which were caused as a result of
this change.

### Ver. 0.2.1

Updated spawn tables for route 101, 102 and 103 with new wild encounters, as well as water
and fishing encounters where applicable. All (Non-Department Store) PokeMarts have now been
updated to use the same item list, which is dependent on the number of badges the player has.
Modified Pokemarts to have stock dependent on the number of badges the player has earned.

### Ver. 0.2.0

Implemented EV/IV increasing/decreasing items - Some Pokeblock-only berries have been repurposed to increase
or decrease IVs by one, and Zinc/Carbos/etc. have been modified to provide 28 EVs at a time in their respective
stat, requiring only 9 to reach the maximum value (252). Feathers have also been modified to provide 4 of their
respective stats, which can be useful for building more fine-grained EV spreads. EV-reducing berries have also
been modified to reduce stats by 28. Item descriptions have been updated to reflect the new behavior. New TM 
behavior has been tested and verified. A bug was fixed where mom would be placed outside (for the running
shoes encounter), even though this encounter has been removed from the game.

### Ver. 0.1.1

Updated TM behavior based on [this](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Infinite-TM-usage) tutorial, now 
infinitely reusable and cannot be sold / bought more than once. Text references to TMs have now been updated 
to reflect new behavior. Replacing a move with a new move will no longer refresh the PP for the move slot

### Ver. 0.1.0

Implemented [Poryscript](https://github.com/huderlem/poryscript) to build pipeline, converted all pre-existing 
map script.inc files to .pory format, removed running shoes event when returning to Littleroot town and enabled 
running shoes flags by default when exiting the truck, Added National Dex upgrade to initial Birch Pokedex event, 
as well as the battle key items (Mega Ring, Z Power Ring, Dynamax Band), Added follow-up event where these items 
can be recieved instead of they are missed initially (for migrated save files). Modified EXP.Share to use Gen 6+ 
behavior (Key item, affects all party members, can be toggled on or off.)
