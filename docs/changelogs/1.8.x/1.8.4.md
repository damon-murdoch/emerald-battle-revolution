## üåã *IMPORTANT CHANGES* üåã
### ***[Reverted Guillotine feature branch](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4525)*** by @AsparagusEduardo:
* This was a runtime decapitalization branch introduced silently in version 1.8.0. We didn't properly announce as it was hastily merged and we were hoping that future versions of it would have fixed issues that we encountered after the merge. However, issues kept piling on and we felt the need to revert it as it was also silently breaking other features as well.
* ***We will work on an alternate decapitalization option in the future***.
